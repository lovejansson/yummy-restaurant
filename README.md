<h2>About</h2> 
<p>The art displays a restaurant simulation set at the Yummy Restaurant where Justin Bieber is performing live with his guitarrist Dan Kanter. On the playlist are the most loved acoustic songs including As long as you love me, Love yourself and Off my face. I created this because I really like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EJ3zbKTWQ8&list=RD8EJ3zbKTWQ8&start_radio=1">Yummy music video</a>, and I thought its candy-funny-food vibe would be fun to turn into a pixel art simulation.</p>
